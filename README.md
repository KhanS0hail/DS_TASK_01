# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship Task 1

Create a bar chart or histrogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable , such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

### Task Completed

This submission fulfills the requirements of Task 1, which was to create a visualization representing the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable. In this case, I analyzed the distribution of total population and male and female populations for the top and bottom ten countries worldwide.


### Methodology:

- **Data Acquisition:** Obtained population data from the World Bank.
- **Data Cleaning:** Prepared the data by handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.
- **Data Analysis:** Conducted exploratory data analysis and created visualizations using Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib,Seaborn).
- **Comparative Analysis:** Compared population trends across different countries and time periods.

### Visualizations:

- **Bar Charts:** Used to represent population distributions and comparisons.
- **Stacked Bar** Charts: Employed to visualize the breakdown of total population into male and female components.
Conclusion:

### Tools and Libraries:

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
